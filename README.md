ABSTRACT

gd T cells are unconventional innate-like T cells characterized by the expression of gd T cell receptor (TCR) with major roles in homoeostasis and disease. Using simultaneous single-cell measurement of transcriptomes and epitopes of gd T cells across seven tissues, we identified their eight major subsets delineated by the expression of Sell, Ly6c2, Cd160, Gzmb, Rorc, Areg, Klrg1 and Mki67. Simultaneous profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility further identified genome-wide chromatin landscape and distinct cell type-specific transcription factor families associated with these subsets. Using parabiosis mouse model to distinguish exchanging and resident gd T cells at a single-cell resolution, we uncover the molecular hallmarks governing their tissue residency across organs and cell states. Cellular states associated with cytotoxicity, IFN-g production and tissue repair functions were more tissue-resident across organs while IL-17-producing gd T (gdT17) cell subsets exhibited organ-specific tissue residency features. Taken together, our data represent the first single-cell multi-organ landscape of gd T cells across three different modalities and provide a highly resolved cellular and molecular map of their tissue residency program.
