ABSTRACT

gd T cells are unconventional T cells which, according to their tissue location and microenvironment, perform heterogenous functions in tissue homeostasis and disease. It is unclear whether these functions correspond to distinct gd subsets or to a homogeneous population of cells exerting context-dependent effector functions. Here, by multimodal single-cell profiling of gd T cells across seven organs, we reveal that various tissues harbor unique site-adapted gd subsets. Epidermal and intestinal intraepithelial gd T cells are transcriptionally homogeneous and exhibit epigenetic hallmarks of functional diversity. Through parabiosis experiments, we discover distinct tissue-resident and exchanging gd subsets. We uncover cellular states associated with cytotoxicity, innate-like rapid IFN-g production and tissue repair functions in the spleen, liver, intestine, and skin displaying tissue residency hallmarks. Notably, our observations nuance the link between IL-17-producing gd T cells and tissue-residency as we identify tissue- and subset-specific residency properties of these cells. Moreover, transcriptional programs associated with tissue-resident gd T cells are analogous to those of CD8+ tissue-resident memory (TRM) T cells. Altogether, this study provides the first multimodal landscape of tissue-adapted gd T cells revealing heterogeneity as well as cellular and molecular hallmarks of their tissue residency program.
