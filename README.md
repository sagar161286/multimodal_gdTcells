ABSTRACT

γδ T cells perform heterogeneous functions in homeostasis and disease across tissues. However, it is unclear whether these roles correspond to distinct γδ subsets or to a homogeneous population of cells exerting context-dependent functions. Here, by cross-organ multimodal single-cell profiling, we reveal that various mouse tissues harbor unique site-adapted γδ subsets. Epidermal and intestinal intraepithelial γδ T cells are transcriptionally homogeneous and exhibit epigenetic hallmarks of functional diversity. Through parabiosis experiments, we uncovered cellular states associated with cytotoxicity, innate-like rapid interferon-γ production and tissue repair functions displaying tissue residency hallmarks. Notably, our observations add nuance to the link between interleukin-17-producing γδ T cells and tissue residency. Moreover, transcriptional programs associated with tissue-resident γδ T cells are analogous to those of CD8+ tissue-resident memory T cells. Altogether, this study provides a multimodal landscape of tissue-adapted γδ T cells, revealing heterogeneity, lineage relationships and their tissue residency program.
